# Bad-Bank
# Jerry Olivarez's Bad Bank

# What Is It?
For this challenge, we were assigned with creating a banking web app that allows a user to create an account, deposit money, withdraw money and also keep track of there banking data. 

## How To Use It
At the home page you will be greeted with the introduction of "Bad Bank". Next at the Nav bar there will be sections of Deposit, Withdraw, AllData and Create Account. On all of those sections you can complete all of those tasks. It is a very simple but effective process.

# What I Found Challenging
What I found to be challenging was getting the balance of the withdraw and deposit section to work. What I did to fix this going back and reading the code using the debugg tool in VSCode and taking the time to really breath and read very carefully.

## Extras
I did not add any extras but if I can add some in the future I would really like to add a calculator.
